# Developing

Edit, preview, and save this research project.

## Preview locally

With [Quarto](https://quarto.org) on the host: `make preview`, open `http://localhost:4848`. `make render` builds once to `_site/`; `make clean` wipes artifacts. Automated callers that report a preview link run `make preview-baseline` before pushing and `make preview-ready` after, which blocks until this push's Pages deployment is live. If a transient API or workflow failure interrupts the wait, the baseline remains so the same command can be retried. The render targets fetch the workspace evidence extension from the latest `asta-plugins` version tag by default; set `ASTA_PLUGINS_REF` to pin a specific release (e.g. `v0.103.0`) or to track `main`. The CI-side deploy assets (the workflow in `docs.yml`, `what-changed.py`, and the vendored-script drift checks) follow the same version-tag policy: the scaffold's literal workflow ref is advanced by the `asta-plugins` release process, and existing projects receive that one-line bump when their workspace assets are upgraded. Offline is tolerated: if the fetch can't reach `asta-plugins` but a previously fetched `_extensions/evidence/` is present, the render keeps that cached copy and warns instead of failing; only a first fetch with no cache is a hard error.

## Devcontainer (`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`)

Based on `ghcr.io/allenai/asta:latest` — Quarto and [Asta](https://asta.allen.ai) pre-installed. Projects with `paper/` use `ghcr.io/allenai/asta:latest-tex`, which adds TeX, LaTeX Workshop, and its build-on-save/PDF-tab settings. Projects do not need to commit `.vscode/settings.json` for these defaults. The image supplies Remote settings, which override User settings; customize them through Workspace settings (`.vscode/settings.json`). The shared recipe keeps outputs in `build/`. Its PDF default loads before user and project `latexmkrc` files, so a paper can choose another engine or DVI/PostScript output.

- **VS Code locally:** `make dev`, or open folder → Command Palette → **Reopen in Container**. Needs [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers). For an in-editor preview, choose **Ports → Preview in Editor**.
- **Codespaces in a browser:** green **`<> Code`** button → **Codespaces** tab → **Create codespace on main**, or `gh codespace create --web` from the CLI. Port 4848 forwards automatically. Click **Open in Browser** in the notification, use **Ports → Open in Browser**, or click the forwarded URL printed in the `postAttachCommand` terminal. These open the site in a separate browser tab. Do not enter `localhost:4848` in Simple Browser: in a browser-based codespace, `localhost` does not reach the forwarded port. Private forwarded URLs may also fail inside the editor because its embedded frame cannot complete GitHub sign-in. Use the separate tab for the Codespaces preview; local VS Code keeps the in-editor preview above.

Asta auth: run `asta auth login` in the container terminal (device-code flow: open the printed URL in any browser). The VS Code agent and CLI share that login, and in Codespaces it survives container rebuilds. Alternatively set an `ASTA_TOKEN` env var locally or as a Codespaces secret. To get the recommended-secret prompt, create the codespace through **Code → Codespaces → New with options**; CLI creation does not prompt. `ASTA_TOKEN` overrides the login when set, so unset a stale one before logging in.

## Editing `.qmd` files in VS Code

- **First open:** the Quarto extension may ask whether to configure Lua support for the evidence filter in `_extensions/`. Answer it (either choice); citation and YAML completions don't start until you do. Check the notification bell if you missed it.
- **Citations:** in a `.qmd` file, type `@` or `[@` to pick keys from `references.bib`. Completions work in `.qmd` files and `_quarto.yml`, not plain `.md`.
- **Visual editor:** Command Palette → **Quarto: Edit in Visual Mode**, or Ctrl+Shift+F4 (Cmd+Shift+F4 on macOS) to toggle. It adds **Insert → Citation** and WYSIWYG tables. Add `editor: visual` to a page's front matter to open it in visual mode by default.
- **Simple Browser (local VS Code only):** with `make preview` running, Command Palette → **Simple Browser: Show** → `http://localhost:4848`, or **Ports → Preview in Editor**. In a browser-based codespace use the separate tab described above.

## Getting a LaTeX PDF

| You want… | Path |
|-----------|------|
| A PDF of the Quarto write-up itself (to share, print, or submit), with the `.qmd` staying primary | Run `quarto render index.qmd --to pdf` with a TeX toolchain such as the `-tex` image. Quarto builds this PDF through LaTeX, so the same source can also emit the `.tex` source that preprint servers and venues ask for (command below) without maintaining a separate paper. Run it on demand; keeping this rendering path outside the shared `make` targets and PR preview is deliberate. |
| A separately written LaTeX paper that reuses the project bibliography | Write `paper/main.tex` citing `../references.bib`. `make paper` builds it, and every PR preview publishes its PDF and a LaTeX diff. In VS Code, LaTeX Workshop (in the `-tex` image) builds on save with SyncTeX. |

The first path is one-way: Quarto writes LaTeX, nothing converts LaTeX back to `.qmd`. If the paper needs to diverge from the site (venue template, heavy hand edits), switch to the second path and let `paper/main.tex` become the primary copy.

Keeping that intermediate LaTeX is useful even when you only want a PDF: preprint servers such as arXiv ask for the TeX source rather than the PDF of a LaTeX-produced paper, journals and conferences often do too, and the `.tex` is the starting point if the paper later moves to the second path. For LaTeX source, run `quarto render index.qmd --to latex -M cite-method:natbib`. This writes `_site/index.tex` with citation commands and a `\bibliography{references.bib}` line. Plain `--to latex` uses citeproc and writes formatted citations into the source instead. The generated `.tex` still needs the bibliography and a successful PDF build before it is ready to submit.

## Back a claim with supporting evidence

A factual claim can carry the source quote that backs it. Add a keyed entry to
`evidence.yml` (verbatim `quote`, a `cite` key from `references.bib`, an optional
`locator` like `p. 4`/`sec. 3.2`/`abstract`), then mark the claim in the `.qmd`:
`[90 tasks]{.ev key="naturebench-count"}`. The claim gets a subtle dotted
underline; hovering it shows the quote and a body-style citation, and the same
popover appears on the `what-changed` diff so a reviewer can check the backing.
Full reference (available after the first render or `make workspace-assets`): [`_extensions/evidence/README.md`](_extensions/evidence/README.md).

## Edit without preview

Edit `.qmd` files on GitHub directly or in any editor.

## Make targets

| target | does |
|---|---|
| `make preview` | live preview on port 4848 |
| `make render` | build to `_site/` |
| `make check` | run the same quality gates CI runs (render + warning validation) |
| `make clean` | wipe build artifacts |
| `make workspace-assets` | refresh the evidence extension from `asta-plugins` (latest version tag by default) |
| `make dev` | open VS Code attached to devcontainer |
| `make deployed-url` | print deployed URL (needs auto-deploy below) |

For the optional `Makefile.managed` entry point, set `ASTA_WORKSPACE_LOCAL_GOALS` before the shared scaffold to list project-only targets that need no managed rules or Asta CLI. Mixed commands that also name a shared target still load the rules; a project-owned `workspace.mk` always takes precedence. That file replaces the managed rules completely, so retain the targets your project uses, including `dev` and `clean`.

Managed rules stay cached until the version selected in `docs.yml` changes or you run `make update-workspace`. With a moving channel such as `@latest`, refresh before comparing a local build with CI, which uses the workflow's current revision. Pin a release tag or commit in `docs.yml` if both must stay on a fixed version.

To adopt managed scripts with `Makefile.managed`, first run `asta workspace sync --refresh --require-scripts`. Only after it succeeds, delete the unmodified `scripts/quarto-check.sh` and `scripts/wait-for-preview.sh` copies and run `make check`. The check verifies that both the installed CLI and the ref selected in `docs.yml` support managed scripts. Check `asta workspace sync --help` for the option; keep project copies until your CLI supports it. Older plugin refs may still require project scripts even with a newer CLI.

Keep any customized script in `scripts/`, which always takes precedence. CI warns when a project copy differs from the workflow's version. To eject one script, copy its cached version into `scripts/`. To eject shared rules, copy `workspace.mk` from your selected asta-plugins version into the project root and copy both scripts into `scripts/` too. Ejected rules alone do not locate the versioned script cache. The standalone full `Makefile` continues to use project scripts without the CLI.

Sync retains old script and archive generations because running builds may still use them. After stopping local builds, delete `.asta/cache/` to reclaim space; the next sync needs network access to fetch it again.

## Auto-deploy (`.github/workflows/docs.yml`)

Every push to `main` and every PR triggers CI checks + deploy. Main: `https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/`. PRs get a preview URL via bot comment.

`docs.yml` is a thin stub: the build/deploy/preview machinery is a shared [reusable workflow](https://github.com/allenai/asta-plugins/blob/main/.github/workflows/workspace-quarto-site.yml) maintained centrally, so fixes flow to this repo without re-copying (pin its ref to a tag if you prefer explicit upgrades).

The PR's “What changed” page uses the version of `what-changed.py` shipped with the reusable workflow. To customize it, commit `scripts/what-changed.py` in your project; that copy takes precedence and runs in the read-only build job. The write-enabled deploy job only publishes its rendered output. A PR that changes the project script runs its changed copy for its own preview, so treat that page as a review aid rather than a trusted check.

A custom script must accept `--old <site-dir>`, `--new <site-dir>`, `--out <html-file>`, and `--title <text>`. It must write a nonempty HTML file to `--out` and exit successfully to publish the page. `--old` is a snapshot of the deployed main site (empty before the first deploy); `--new` is the PR's rendered `_site/`.

### Managed paper HTML viewers

For each discovered LaTeX paper, the shared preview generates `<paper-dir>/html/index.qmd` before `make check`. This page embeds the LaTeXML rendition in the Quarto site and links the PDF; the paper's HTML and PDF diffs remain in What changed. Keep the LaTeX source and bibliography committed, and ignore the generated viewer directory. There is no viewer script to copy into the project.

Add the viewer path to `project.render` if your `_quarto.yml` uses an explicit render list, and link it from your navbar or write-up. Automatic render discovery includes it without a list. Local Quarto-only previews can omit this generated page; the full paper viewer is built by the shared CI preview.

To customize or eject the viewer, commit your own `<paper-dir>/html/index.qmd` (or `index.md`/`index.html`); existing pages are left untouched. A committed `scripts/paper-viewer.py` overrides the generator. This supports separately written LaTeX papers; Quarto-to-PDF stays an on-demand render of the `.qmd` source.

CI runs `make check` — the identical command you can run locally before pushing, so a local pass predicts the CI result. New quality gates belong in the `check` target (or a prerequisite target), not in workflow files, so local and CI can't drift.

Projects can set `artifact-command: make preview-artifact-check` under the reusable workflow's `with:` inputs to validate or extend the completed `_site/` (including paper previews and What changed). It runs with read-only permissions before upload and deployment; a failure prevents publication. Leave it unset to keep the usual behavior of publishing the Quarto site even when a paper fails.
